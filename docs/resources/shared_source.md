## Schema

### Required

- `title` (String) A descriptive name for the shared source.
- `type` (String) The type of source that should be shared. This is typically the name of the source componenet, e.g. `kinesis-firehose`. The source must be a "push source", thus pull sources cannot be shared and will result in an error.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Details describing the shared source.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The id of the shared source.
