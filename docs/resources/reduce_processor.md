Combine multiple events over time into one based on a set of criteria



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `pipeline_id` (String) The uuid of the pipeline

### Optional

- `date_formats` (Attributes List) Describes which root-level properties are dates, and their expected format. Dot-notation is supported, but nested field lookup paths will be an error. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--date_formats))
- `description` (String) A user-defined value describing the processor
- `duration_ms` (Number) The amount of time (in milliseconds) to allow streaming events to accumulate into a single "reduced" event. The process repeats indefinitely, or until an "ends when" condition is satisfied.
- `flush_condition` (Attributes) Force accumulated event reduction to flush the result when a conditional expression evaluates to true on an inbound event. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--flush_condition))
- `group_by` (List of String) Before reducing, group events based on matching data from each of these field paths. Supports nesting via dot-notation.
- `inputs` (List of String) The ids of the input components
- `max_events` (Number) The maximum number of events that can be included in a time window (specified by duration_ms). The reduce operation will stop once it has reached this number of events, regardless of whether the duration_ms have elapsed.
- `merge_strategies` (Attributes List) Specify merge strategies for individual root-level properties. Dot-notation is supported, but nested field lookup paths will be an error. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--merge_strategies))
- `title` (String) A user-defined title for the processor

### Read-Only

- `generation_id` (Number) An internal field used for component versioning
- `id` (String) The uuid of the processor
