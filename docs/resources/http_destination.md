# mezmo_http_destination (Resource)

Represents an HTTP destination.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    mezmo = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/mezmo/mezmo"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 1.1.0"
}

provider "mezmo" {
  auth_key = "my secret"
}

resource "mezmo_pipeline" "pipeline1" {
  title = "My pipeline"
}

resource "mezmo_demo_source" "source1" {
  pipeline_id = mezmo_pipeline.pipeline1.id
  title       = "My source"
  description = "This is the point of entry for our data"
  format      = "nginx"
}

resource "mezmo_http_destination" "webhook" {

## Schema

### Required

- `pipeline_id` (String) The uuid of the pipeline
- `uri` (String) The full URI to make HTTP requests to. This should include the protocol and host, but can also include the port, path, and any other valid part of a URI.

### Optional

- `ack_enabled` (Boolean) Acknowledge data from the source when it reaches the destination
- `auth` (Attributes) Configures HTTP authentication (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--auth))
- `compression` (String) The compression strategy used on the encoded data prior to sending
- `description` (String) A user-defined value describing the destination
- `encoding` (String) The encoding to apply to the data
- `headers` (Map of String) A key/value object describing a header name and its value
- `inputs` (List of String) The ids of the input components
- `max_bytes` (Number) The maximum number of uncompressed bytes when batching data to the destination
- `method` (String) The HTTP method to use for the destination.
- `payload_prefix` (String) Add a prefix to the payload. Only used for serialized JSON chunks. This option also requires 'Payload Suffix' to form a valid JSON string.
- `payload_suffix` (String) Used in combination with 'Payload Prefix' to form valid JSON from the payload.
- `proxy` (Attributes) Proxy Settings (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--proxy))
- `rate_limiting` (Attributes) Settings for controlling rate limiting to the destination. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rate_limiting))
- `timeout_secs` (Number) The number of seconds before a destination write timeout.
- `title` (String) A user-defined title for the destination
- `tls_protocols` (List of String) A list of ALPN protocols to use during TLS negotiation. They are attempted in the order they appear.

### Read-Only

- `generation_id` (Number) An internal field used for component versioning
- `id` (String) The uuid of the destination
