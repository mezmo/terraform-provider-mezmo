# mezmo_absence_alert (Resource)

Represents an Absence Alert in a Pipeline

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    mezmo = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/mezmo/mezmo"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 1.1.0"
}

provider "mezmo" {
  auth_key = "my secret"
}

resource "mezmo_pipeline" "my_pipeline" {
  title = "pipeline"
}
resource "mezmo_prometheus_remote_write_source" "metrics_source" {
  pipeline_id = mezmo_pipeline.my_pipeline.id
  title       = "My Prometheus Remote Write source"
  description = "This receives data from prometheus"
}
resource "mezmo_absence_alert" "no_data_alert" {
  pipeline_id             = mezmo_pipeline.my_pipeline.id
  component_kind          = "source"
  component_id            = mezmo_prometheus_remote_write_source.metrics_source.id
  inputs                  = [mezmo_prometheus_remote_write_source.metrics_source.id]
  name                    = "metrics absence alert"
  event_type              = "metric"
  window_duration_minutes = 15
  subject                 = "No data received!"
  severity                = "WARNING"
  body                    = "There has been no metrics data recieved in the last 15 minutes!"
  ingestion_key           = "abc123"
}

## Schema

### Required

- `body` (String) The message body to use when the alert is sent. For a `template` style, surround the field path in double curly braces.
```
{{.my_field}} had a count of {{metadata.aggregate.event_count}}
```
- `component_id` (String) The uuid of the component that the alert is attached to
- `component_kind` (String) The kind of component that the alert is attached to
- `event_type` (String) The type of event is either a Log event or a Metric event.
- `ingestion_key` (String, Sensitive) The key required to ingest the alert into Log Analysis
- `inputs` (List of String) The ids of the input components. This could be the id of a match arm for a route processor, or simply the id of the component.
- `name` (String) The name of the alert.
- `pipeline_id` (String) The uuid of the pipeline
- `subject` (String) The subject line to use when the alert is sent. For a `template` style, surround the field path in double curly braces.
```
{{.my_field}} had a count of {{metadata.aggregate.event_count}}
```

### Optional

- `active` (Boolean) Indicates if the alert is turned on or off
- `description` (String) An optional description describing what the alert is for.
- `event_timestamp` (String) The path to a field on the event that contains an epoch timestamp value. If an event does not have a timestamp field, events will be associated to the wall clock value when the event is processed. Required for Log event types and disallowed for Metric event types.
- `group_by` (List of String) When aggregating, group events based on matching values from each of these field paths. Supports nesting via dot-notation. This value is optional for Metric event types, and SHOULD be used for Log event types.
- `severity` (String) The severity level of the alert.
- `style` (String) Configuration for how the alert message will be constructed. For `static`, exact strings will be used. For `template`, the alert subjec and body will allow for placeholders to substitute values from the event.
- `window_duration_minutes` (Number) The duration of the aggregation window in minutes.
- `window_type` (String) Sliding windows can overlap, whereas tumbling windows are disjoint. For example, a tumbling window has a fixed time span and any events that fall within the "window duration" will be used in the aggregate. In a sliding window, the aggregation occurs every "window duration" seconds after an event is encountered.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The uuid of the alert
