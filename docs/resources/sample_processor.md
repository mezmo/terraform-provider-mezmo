# mezmo_sample_processor (Resource)

Sample data at a given rate, retaining only a subset of data events for further processing

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    mezmo = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/mezmo/mezmo"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 1.1.0"
}

provider "mezmo" {
  auth_key = "my secret"
}

resource "mezmo_pipeline" "pipeline1" {
  title = "My pipeline"
}

resource "mezmo_http_source" "curl" {
  pipeline_id = mezmo_pipeline.pipeline1.id
  title       = "My data stream"
  description = "Send Curl data to the pipeline point of entry URL"
  decoding    = "json"
}

resource "mezmo_sample_processor" "processor1" {
  pipeline_id = mezmo_pipeline.pipeline1.id
  title       = "My second sample processor"
  description = "Let's sample some data while keeping other events intact"
  inputs      = [mezmo_http_source.curl.id]
  rate        = 100
  always_include = {
    field          = ".my_app"
    operator       = "starts_with"
    value_string   = "Server"
    case_sensitive = false
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `pipeline_id` (String) The uuid of the pipeline

### Optional

- `always_include` (Attributes) Events matching this criteria will always show up in the results (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--always_include))
- `description` (String) A user-defined value describing the processor
- `inputs` (List of String) The ids of the input components
- `rate` (Number) The rate at which events will be forwarded, expressed as 1/N. For example, `rate = 10` means 1 out of every 10 events will be forwarded and the rest will be dropped
- `title` (String) A user-defined title for the processor

### Read-Only

- `generation_id` (Number) An internal field used for component versioning
- `id` (String) The uuid of the processor

<a id="nestedatt--always_include"></a>
### Nested Schema for `always_include`

Required:

- `field` (String) The field to use in a condition to always include in sampling
- `operator` (String) The comparison operator to check the value of the field or whether the first exists

Optional:

- `case_sensitive` (Boolean) Perform case sensitive comparison?
- `value_number` (Number) The operand to compare the field value with, when the value is a number
- `value_string` (String) The operand to compare the field value with, when the value is a string
